            I’m a student at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science and Environmental Economics, 
            with a minor in Data Science. Growing up adapting to new 
            environments taught me how powerful the right tools and support systems can be, a 
            perspective that continues to shape how I think about and build software.

            Through my coursework, I’ve built a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, 
            machine learning, and more. I’m interested in software development and 
            machine learning, and how they can create impact.
